# Languages I Know
I'm comfortable programming in a few languages, but I can work in a pretty reasonable variety. Here is an overview of all the languages I would say I "know":

- JavaScript
- C#
- Java
- Python
- C++
- HTML and CSS

Here is a more in-depth explanation of my connection with each language.

## JavaScript
I have worked with JavaScript a lot. A lot of the projects I create are in JavaScript. I've used large frameworks like React (with WebPack and Babel), but I can still create web pages/applications without (or with minimal) libraries.

I also haveu sed JavaScript with node.js to create server-side and command line applications. This is definetly the language I am most comfortable with.

## C Sharp
Mainly, I have used C# with unity to create 3d projects or games. I'm quite comfortable with the syntax.

## Python
My experiments with machine learning come from here. I have also used it for some data processing (mainly to prepare data for machine learning).

## Java
My knowledge with Java isn't super strong, but I can work with it. I took the AP Computer Science A test (which is in Java) and got a 5. I've also played around with some Java programming, and a few years ago I used to mainly program in this.

## C++
Pretty weak here. I have a fairly solid grasp of pointers (generally), but the low level nature of this language (and even more so, C) messes with me. My biggest project with this would probably be my [raytracing project](raytracing.html).

## HTML and CSS
These might not be true programming languages, but CSS does have some depth and I have a reasonable grasp to them. I can put things where I want to on webpages, for the most part.
