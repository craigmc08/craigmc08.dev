# Languages I Know
I'm comfortable programming in a few languages, but I can work with a fair amount of languages. Here is an overview of all the languages I would say I know:

- JavaScript
- C#
- Java
- Python
- C++
- HTML and CSS

Here is a more in-depth explanation of my connection with each language.

## JavaScript
I have worked with JavaScript a lot. A lot of the projects I create are in JavaScript. I've used large frameworks like React (with WebPack and Babel), but I can still create web pages/applications without (or with minimal) libraries.

I also have used JavaScript with node.js to create server-side and command line applications. This is definitely the language I am most comfortable with.

## C Sharp
Mainly, I have used C# with the Unity Game Engine to create 3d projects or games. I'm quite comfortable with the syntax and programming patterns in this language.

## Python
My experiments with machine learning come from here. I have also used it for some data processing (mainly to prepare data for machine learning).

## Java
My knowledge with Java isn't super strong, but I can work with it. I've played around with some Java programming, and a few years ago I used to program mostly in this language.

## C++
I can create programs in this language, but my understanding is not super strong. I have a fairly solid grasp of pointers (generally), but the low-level nature of this language (and even more so, C) messes with me. My biggest project with this would probably be my [raytracing project](raytracing.html).

## HTML and CSS
These might not be true programming languages, but CSS does have some depth and I have a reasonable grasp to them. I can put things where I want to on webpages, for the most part.
