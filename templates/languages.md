# Languages I Know
I am comfortable programming in any of the languages listed below. Here is an overview of all the languages I would say I know:

- JavaScript
- C#
- Java
- Python
- C++
- HTML and CSS

Here is a more in-depth explanation of my connection with each language.

## JavaScript
I have worked extensively with JavaScript. Many of the projects I create are in JavaScript. I've used large frameworks like React (with WebPack and Babel), but I can still create web pages/applications without (or with minimal) libraries.

I also have used JavaScript with node.js to create server-side and command line applications. This is definitely the language I am most comfortable with.

## Haskell
I began learning Haskell in August, 2019. I am now comfortable in the language and consider myself proficient with the functional programming style. My current project with this is a raytraced rendering engine. Check out the project page [here](/haskell-raytracer).

## C Sharp
Mainly, I have used C# with the Unity Game Engine to create 3d projects or games. I'm quite comfortable with the syntax and programming patterns in this language.

## Java
I've played around with some Java programming, and a few years ago I used to program mostly in this language.

## Python
My experiments with machine learning come from here. I have also used it for some data processing, mainly to prepare data for machine learning.

## C++
I can create programs in this language, but my understanding is not super strong. I have a fairly solid grasp of pointers, but the low-level nature of this language has been challenging to me. My biggest C++ project is [raytracing project](raytracing.html).

## HTML and CSS
These might not be true programming languages, but CSS does have some depth and I have a solid understanding of them. I can build web sites.
