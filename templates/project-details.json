The image above is an image that my program can render. <a href=\"https://github.com/craigmc08/raytracing/raw/master/renders/raymarcher.png\">Here's a link to a unscaled version.</a></p><p>I went through a few iterations of programs before arriving at my final structure. At first, I was writing fairly messy, 1 file programs while I was trying to understand how the raytracing works. Now, I'd say I have a fairly deep understanding of the mechanics of raymarched render engines, and the codebase I've developed makes it almost easy to write new scenes.</p>"

More yellow/brighter means that I have spent more time in that area.</p><p>The project creates a command-line tool to generate these heatmaps. Basic usage is <code>ski-heat-map ./tracks ./heatmap.png</code>. This pulls skiing data from the tracks folder. To collect the data, I used the <a href=\"https://www.corecoders.com/ski-tracks-app/\">Ski Tracks</a> app. More information can be found in the github repository.</p>"
