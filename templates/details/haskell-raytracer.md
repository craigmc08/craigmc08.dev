This is another raytraced 3d renderer, but it's written in Haskell. I have plans for many features for this program, including the ability to load scenes and 3d geometry from files. Currently, it supports Diffuse shaders, global illumination, ambient occlusion, and soft shadows from directional lights, and multi-core CPU rendering.

Plans include: more shaders, depth of field, lens effects, a BVH graph for optimization, volumetric shaders, and more. For a complete list, read the [README on the github page](https://github.com/craigmc08/haskell-raytracer#plans).

This raytracer is very much a work in progress. I'll keep this page updated as I make progress with it.
