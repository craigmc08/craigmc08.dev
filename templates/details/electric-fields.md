This is web page I created to visually demonstrate the electric fields produced by point charges. There are two methods of visualization in this program. The first uses hue to indicate direction and brightness for strength. The second draws electric field lines, but it isn't totally correct.

[Here's the link to the page.](https://craigmc08.github.io/electric-fields/) You can drag around the points shown on the screen with your mouse, or add/remove points with the buttons. It doesn't work on mobile yet (it would be pretty slow).

It's built in JavaScript with no client-side libraries (only some packages for combining and bundling code). The visual uses the Canvas element, and all the pixels are calculated and placed onto the Canvas element.
