            <h1>raytracing</h1>
            <p>I started this raytracing project after reading about the postcard-sized raytracer. It just caught my fascination and I spent a few weeks building this program. The image above is an image that my program can render. <a href="https://github.com/craigmc08/raytracing/raw/master/renders/raymarcher.png">Here's a link to a unscaled version.</a></p><p>I went through a few iterations of programs before arriving at my final structure. At first, I was writing fairly messy, 1 file programs while I was trying to understand how the raytracing works. Now, I'd say I have a fairly deep understanding of the mechanics of raymarched render engines, and the codebase I've developed makes it almost easy to write new scenes.</p>
